Solves convex cone programs via operator splitting. Can solve: linear programs (LPs), second-order cone programs (SOCPs), semidefinite programs (SDPs), exponential cone programs (ECPs), and power cone programs (PCPs), or problems with any combination of those cones. See http://github.com/cvxgrp/scs for more details.
